Var declaration --> var myVar:string = "Variable string" or var myVar = "Variable string"

print(myVar)

* No semi colon like C, CPP.


Another important thing of structure is, the keywords after the structure's name denotes the protocol it will conform to. Normally the keywords after the variable or constant's name denotes data type. But for structure, it is protocol.
There are many protocols: App, Scene, View, etc. A good example is to see a new SwiftUI project in Xcode.


### Structure:

variables/constants are called properties of strcuture.

functions inside a structure --> method of that structure.

A new learning: computed property, a property that return computed value. It is a variable with a function-like structure.


@State before the variable declaration.

For abstraction, use private/public keywords before the variable declaration.

@State private var someVariable = 0
